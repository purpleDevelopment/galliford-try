            <p>Back to Basics is a refocus. It is about concentrating on what is important to enable YOU to carry out
                YOUR tasks safely. </p>
            <p>A significant proportion of incidents on Galliford Try sites are caused by either the wrong person, the
                wrong equipment, a lack of planning or site conditions which are not conducive to safe working. Simply
                put, Back to Basics will achieve a greater level of Health and Safety performance. Back to Basics has
                four key elements for you to ask yourselves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The right person</li>
                <li>The right equipment</li>
                <li>The right planning</li>
                <li>The right workplace</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To work safely on a Galliford Try Group site, YOU must answer yes to all the above points. If the answer
                to one or more of the above is no, you have the authority of the Galliford Try Executive Chairman to
                stop work and speak to your Supervisor. YOU must not recommence until YOU can answer yes to all of the
                above points. </p>
            <p>Galliford Try firmly believe that if all persons on our sites can answer yes to the above points, we can
                eliminate the vast majority of our incidents. We believe everybody has the right to go home safely every
                day â€“ do you share our vision?</p>
